            <p>
                hi! i’m devanshi — researcher, writer, designer, full-stack developer, and chronic overthinker turned creative weapon.<br>

                i build things on the internet that look good, work well, and say something. this project was born from my obsession with self-mastery and a refusal to coast through life on default settings. i believe knowledge is both armor and art — and i like turning it into things people actually want to read, learn, or use.<br>

                i’ve got a thing for systems — breaking them, rebuilding them, understanding how they shape us. i read like a maniac, design like a storyteller, and write like i’m running out of time. when i’m not deep in a codebase or mid-rant about internet culture, you’ll probably find me making weirdly specific moodboards, dissecting meme evolution, or building brands with too much personality.<br>

                i made this space because i couldn’t find one that did it all — something sharp, self-aware, funny, and actually useful. not “influencer wellness,” not productivity bro-core. just real tools, smart language, and a little bit of chaos.<br>

                i’m currently based in india, building a creative life with clarity, curiosity, and just the right amount of rebellion.<br>

                thanks for being here — let’s evolve loud.
            </p>
